## Story of our information visualization project

### Intro

"If you look up into the sky during a clear night, you will find it covered with stars. But what
kind of stars are there? How far away are they exactly and which ones are the closest? Is
the brightest star in the sky really the most luminous one?" All the answer you can find in our Stellarmap.

### Overview and manual

In this 3D visualization project you can explore stars in space. At the beginning you are at the position of our sun (Sol).
On the left side you can see in the box "Selected Star" the information about the current selected star such as designation (name), spectraltype, uminosity and more.
On the right side you see a legend with all spectral types. Those stars are classified by their lights’ spectra (the elements that they absorb)and their temperature. There are seven main types of stars. In order of decreasing temperature, O, B, A, F, G, K, and M.

Stellarmap control:

- To rotate in any direction you can hold down and move the mouse.
- For zooming in and out you can move the mousewheel
- To get information about other stars you can select any star with one click. Information in the box will be adjusted to the selected star.
- If you want to go to any star, you can double-click on it.
- If you want to go back to the start position, you can click the button "Back to Sol". You are then back at the position of the sun.
